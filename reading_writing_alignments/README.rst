Reading Multiple-sequence Alignment Files
=========================================

The previous sections looked at Biopython's ``SeqIO`` module for
sequence file input and output
(`reading <../reading_sequence_files/README.rst>_` and
`writing <../writing_sequence_files/README.rst>_` sequence files).

Now we come to the ``AlignIO`` module which as the name suggests
is for alignment input and ouput. Note that this is focused on
dealing with multiple sequence alignments of the kind typically
used in phylogenetics -- a separate ``SearchIO`` module targets
pairwise alignments generated by search tools like BLAST.

Writing Multiple-sequence Alignment Files
=========================================

As you might guess from using ``SeqIO.write(...)``, there is a
matching ``AlignIO.write(...)`` function.
